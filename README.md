Modifications
=================

For these files, I change the background color, font size and the font to Times New Roman generally. I add the underline to the top header(very first line in html), and I move the information of the book and contents to the center of the page. This part of some html files were put into one block, while I broke them into small pieces in order to set different looks. Also, I add the border to the title of the book and make the authr, chapters to be italic and also put underline. Moreover, for the cover image of the book, I add a circle border to the picture, and use the filter to blur and make the image become to be grayscale.
